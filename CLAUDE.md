## Code Conventions

- Always use type hints on function signatures
- Prefer functions over classes unless persistent state is needed
- Use `loguru` for logging — never `print()`
- One responsibility per function — if it needs a comment explaining what it does, split it
- Tests live in `tests/` mirroring `src/` structure (e.g. `src/services/user.py` → `tests/services/test_user.py`)
- Write tests alongside new code, not after
- Use `pydantic` for data validation and serialization
- Environment variables via `python-dotenv` — never hardcode secrets

## What NOT To Do

> These are guardrails. Do not override them without explicit human instruction.

**Code guardrails:**
- **Do not add dependencies** without asking first
- **Do not refactor files** unrelated to the current task
- **Do not change the database schema** without explicit instruction
- **Do not remove error handling** to simplify code
- **Do not use `Any` type** — be specific
- **Do not write `TODO` comments** — either implement it or raise it as a task
- **Do not use `time.sleep()`** in production code — use proper async patterns
- **Do not commit secrets** — use `.env` and ensure `.gitignore` covers it

**Operating guardrails (from hard-won failures — see BLUEPRINT.md):**
- **Do not set a thinking model as the active model.** Thinking models leave `content` empty and put output in `reasoning_content`, which breaks parsing. The model must be non-thinking local OR frontier.
- **Do not retry the same failing fix more than twice.** Two strikes → escalate to a frontier model, or halt and leave a note.
- **Do not trust your own "it works" — only passing tests confirm success.** Run `pytest`. The tests are ground truth, not your assessment. Do not mark a task done on self-judgment.
- **Do not proceed past an unreachable LM Studio or a missing service** — halt and report.
- **Do not invent product or architecture decisions to fill an ambiguous spec** — that is the human's job. Halt and ask.
- **Do not run destructive commands** (`rm -rf`, `git push --force`, drop tables, delete files outside the project) — halt and ask.

## LLM Correction Log

> When the LLM makes a mistake and you correct it, log it here.
> This is the most valuable section — it prevents repeat mistakes.
> A project 6 months in should have a rich log. That means the system is working.

| Date | Mistake | Guard Added |
|------|---------|-------------|
| [DATE] | [What went wrong] | [What rule prevents recurrence] |
